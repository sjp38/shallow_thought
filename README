Shallow Thought
===============

This is a tool for logging and posting simple, short, and shallow thoughts in
the CLI way.  It aims to be simple and light so that it could be conveniently
used on every devices including the Tmux environment on phones.


Getting Started
===============

Initialization
--------------

Place this directory on your machine.

    $ git clone https://github.com/sjp38/shallow_thought

Make a remote blank git repo somewhere (e.g., gitlab or github).  Let's
assume you set your blank git repo at ``https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts``.
Then, make a directory that will be used as a local storage of your thoughts.

    $ mkdir my_thoughts

Move to your local storage and initialize the local storage to follow the
remote repo.  Your thoughts will be automatically backed up on the remote repo.

    $ cd my_thoughts
    $ ../shallow_thought/st init https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts

The basic usage of this tool is:

    $ st <subcommand> [options]

In the above example command, 'init' is the subcommand and
'https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts' is the option.


Save Thoughts
-------------

``new`` subcommand receives your thought as string.  Then, it will pull the
thoughts in the remote storage (``https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts`` in this
example) on your local storage, save your thought on it and push to the remote
storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/st new "Let it go."


Show Thoughts
-------------

``show`` subcommand lists your past thoughts that you saved via this tool on
the local storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/st show

By giving ``--random`` option, you can randomly pick a thought to show.

    $ ../shallow_thought/st show --random


Remove Thoughts
---------------

``remove`` subcommand removes one or more latest thoughts you wish to remove.
Note that removal will be also applied on your remote storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/st remove <number of latest thoughts to remove>

If you don't provide the ``<number of latest thoughts to remove>``, it will
remove only one latest thought.


Overwrite Thoughts
------------------

``overwrite`` subcommand receives your thought as string and overwrite the
latest thought with it and push to the remote storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/st overwrite "Slam the door."


Export Thoughts
---------------

``export`` subcommand stores each of your thoughts in a text file.

    $ ../shallow_thought/st export

The command will say where the thoughts are exported.
