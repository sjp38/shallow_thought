Shallow Thought
===============

This is a tool for logging and posting simple, short, and shallow thoughts in
the CLI way.  It aims to be simple and light so that it could be conveniently
used on every devices including the Tmux environment on phones.


Getting Started
===============

Initialization
--------------

Place this directory on your machine.

    $ git clone https://github.com/sjp38/shallow_thought

Make a remote blank git repo somewhere (e.g., gitlab or github).  Let's
assume you set your blank git repo at ``https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts``.
Then, make a directory that will be used as a local storage of your thoughts.

    $ mkdir my_thoughts

Move to your local storage and initialize the local storage to follow the
remote repo.  Your thoughts will be automatically backed up on the remote repo.

    $ cd my_thoughts
    $ ../shallow_thought/init.sh https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts


Save Thoughts
-------------

``new.sh`` receives your thought as string.  Then, it will pull the thoughts in
the remote storage (``https://github.com/foo/my_thoughts`` in this example) on
your local storage, save your thought on it and push to the remote storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/new.sh "Let it go."


Show Thoughts
-------------

``show.sh`` lists your past thoughts that you saved via this tool on the local
storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/show.sh

By giving ``--random`` option, you can randomly pick a thought to show.

    $ ../shallow_thought/show.sh --random


Overwrite Thoughts
------------------

``overwrite.sh`` receives your thought as string and overwrite the latest
thought with it and push to the remote storage.

    $ ../shallow_thought/overwrite.sh "Slam the door."
